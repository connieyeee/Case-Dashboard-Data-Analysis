## 1. Project Overview
The project focuses on Adventure Works Cycles, a fictional multinational manufacturing company within the AdventureWorks Database. Using Power Query and DAX measures, an analysis was conducted, providing valuable insights into the company's performance. An interactive dashboard was created for data visualization, showcasing the results of the analysis.

## 2. Specifications
The analysis involves defining key performance indicators (KPIs) like adjusted price through what-if analysis, return rates, and various rolling revenue metrics. Additionally, the project includes three pages: 
- Executive Summary offering an overview of company performance
- Product Detail page focusing on product-specific metrics
- Customer Detail page analyzing customer-centric KPIs.

The results will be presented through an interactive dashboard, enabling users to explore data and gain valuable insights for data-driven decision-making.

## 5. Lessons Learned

### Technology Challenges

During this project, we encountered and overcame various technology challenges to analyze the AdventureWorks Database effectively. Key technology challenges included:

- **Data Modeling and Relationship:** Creating a robust data model with well-defined relationships, primary keys, and foreign keys was crucial for accurate analysis and insights.

- **Schema Creation:** Organizing the database schema efficiently facilitated seamless data manipulation and retrieval, contributing to the overall success of the project.

- **DAX Functions:** Leveraging Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functions such as filtering, conditional statements (IF), rolling functions, year-to-date (YTD), and actual vs. pre-month comparison was essential to compute significant KPIs for evaluating the company's performance.

- **What-If Analysis:** Performing what-if analysis, particularly with price adjustments, allowed us to understand the potential impact on revenue and profit, providing valuable decision-making insights.

### Business Insights

The data analysis process yielded valuable business insights into Adventure Works Cycles' performance:

- **Sales Performance:** Analyzing adjusted prices and sales data revealed top-performing products and sales trends, identifying growth opportunities.

- **Customer Behavior:** Insights from return rates and customer purchase patterns aided in understanding customer satisfaction and loyalty, enhancing retention strategies.

- **Revenue Trends:** Examining rolling revenue metrics and YTD revenue offered a clear view of financial performance, guiding decision-making.

- **Competitive Analysis:** Comparing current revenue against pre-month revenue helped assess the company's competitive position and informed marketing and sales strategies.

The successful integration of technology and business insights enabled data-driven decision-making and provided valuable recommendations for optimizing business performance.
