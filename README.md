The project focuses on Adventure Works Cycles, a fictional multinational manufacturing company within the AdventureWorks Database. Using Power Query and DAX measures, an analysis was conducted, providing valuable insights into the company's performance. An interactive dashboard was created for data visualization, showcasing the results of the analysis.

## 2. Specifications
The analysis involves defining key performance indicators (KPIs) like adjusted price through what-if analysis, return rates, and various rolling revenue metrics. Additionally, the project includes three pages: 
- Executive Summary offering an overview of company performance

- Customer Detail page analyzing customer-centric KPIs.

The results will be presented through an interactive dashboard, enabling users to explore data and gain valuable insights for data-driven decision-making.
